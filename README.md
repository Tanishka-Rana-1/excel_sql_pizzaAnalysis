🍕 Pizza Sales Analytics Project
This is one of my assignments under the Angaar Batch Summer Training program, guided by LPU mentor Gaurika Dhingra.

🚀 About the project
I explored a popular dataset — Pizza Sales Data — to derive meaningful business insights using a combination of:

SQL (for data cleaning, transformation & joins)

Excel (for dashboard creation, HLOOKUP, VLOOKUP, conditional formatting, charts & KPIs).

This project helped me learn how to transform raw data into a dynamic, visually appealing dashboard, enabling decision-makers to quickly understand trends in sales, orders, and customer preferences.

🛠 Tools & Skills Used
✅ MySQL

Imported 4 tables (Orders, Order_Details, Pizzas, Pizza_Types)

Performed multiple joins to combine data

Wrote queries to calculate metrics like total sales, most popular pizzas, highest revenue days, etc.

✅ Excel

Used advanced functions (SUM, AVERAGE, ROUND, CONCAT, LEFT, RIGHT, SUBSTITUTE, IF, AND, OR)

Applied VLOOKUP to connect different datasets vertically

Applied HLOOKUP on transposed data to demonstrate horizontal lookups

Added slicers for dynamic filtering (by date, pizza category, size, day of week)

Used conditional formatting to highlight important metrics

Created an interactive dashboard with:

KPIs (Total Revenue, Total Orders, Top Selling Pizza)

Trend charts (by day of week, month)

Pie charts for high-priced pizzas

Bar & line charts for category & size-wise sales distribution

🎯 Key Insights
📊 Total Revenue: $817.9K
🍕 Top Selling Pizza: The Barbecue Chicken Pizza
📅 Peak Sales Day: Friday
📈 Most Popular Size: Large (L)

🎨 Dashboard Theme
Inspired by a warm beige & red palette, reflecting the cozy, inviting feel of pizza outlets.

Used consistent color coding for charts & slicers.



💡 What I Learned
✅ Data modeling & schema relationship in SQL
✅ Using HLOOKUP vs VLOOKUP for different data orientations
✅ Advanced Excel functions & conditional formatting
✅ Storytelling with data by designing dashboards that quickly highlight business KPIs
